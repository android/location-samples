Recognizing the User's Current Activity
=======================================

Demonstrates use of the [ActivityRecognitionApi][1] to recognize a user's current
activity, such as walking, driving, or standing still.

Introduction
============

Demonstrates use of the [ActivityRecognitionApi][1] to recognize a user's current
activity, such as walking, driving, or standing still.

Users can request activity updates by pressing the "Request Updates" button,
and stop receiving updates using the "Remove Updates" button.

The sample uses an `IntentService` to process detected activity changes, which
are sent using [ActivityRecognitionResult][2] objects. The IntentService gets a
list of probable detected activities and broadcasts them through a BroadcastReceiver. See the
[DetectedActivity][3] class for a list of DetectedActivity types. Each
`DetectedActivity` is associated with a confidence level, which is an int
between 0 and 100.

To run this sample, **location must be enabled**.

Location Updates
================

Demonstrates how to use the Fused Location Provider API to get updates about a
device's location. The Fused Location Provider is part of the Google Play
services Location APIs.


Introduction
============

This sample builds on the BasicLocationSample sample included in this repo,
and allows the user to request periodic location updates. In response, the API
updates the app periodically with the best available location, based on the
currently-available location providers such as WiFi and GPS (Global
Positioning System). The accuracy of the location is also determined by the
location permissions you've requested (we use the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION here)
and the options you set in the location request.


This sample uses the
[FusedLocationProviderClient] (https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationServices.html).

To run this sample, **location must be enabled**.

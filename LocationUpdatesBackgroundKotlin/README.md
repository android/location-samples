Location Updates in the Background (Kotlin)
===========================================
Demonstrates retrieving location updates in the background.

Introduction
============
This app allows a user to receive location updates in the background via a `PendingIntent`.

If you are just interested in seeing the code that subscribes to a location request, please
review the **`MyLocationManager`** file and the **`LocationUpdatesBroadcastReceiver`** file for the
BroadcastReceiver triggered by location changes.

Users have four options in Android 11+ regarding location:
* One time only
* Allow while app is in use, i.e., while app is in foreground
* Allow all the time
* Not allow location at all

In addition to the FINE location permission (`android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`), if you do
have an approved use case for receiving location updates in the background, it will require an
additional permission (`android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`).

To run this sample, **location must be enabled**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You should generally prefer 'while-in-use' for location updates, i.e., receiving
location updates while the app is in use and create a foreground service (tied to a Notification)
when the user navigates away from the app. To learn how to do that instead, review the
[Receive location updates in Android 10 with Kotlin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/while-in-use-location/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)
codelab.

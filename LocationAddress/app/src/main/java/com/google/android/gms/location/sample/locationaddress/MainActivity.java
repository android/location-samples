/**
 * Getting the Location Address.
 *
 * Demonstrates how to use the {@link android.location.Geocoder} API and reverse geocoding to
 * display a device's location as an address. Uses an IntentService to fetch the location address,
 * and a ResultReceiver to process results sent by the IntentService.
 *
 * Android has two location request settings:
 * {@code ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} and {@code ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}. These settings control
 * the accuracy of the current location. This sample uses ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, as defined in
 * the AndroidManifest.xml.
 *
 * For a starter example that displays the last known location of a device using a longitude and latitude,
 * see https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/BasicLocation.
 *
 * For an example that shows location updates using the Fused Location Provider API, see
 * https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/LocationUpdates.
 *
 * This sample uses Google Play services (GoogleApiClient) but does not need to authenticate a user.
 * For an example that uses authentication, see
 * https://github.com/googlesamples/android-google-accounts/tree/master/QuickStart.

Creating and Monitoring Geofences
=================================

Demonstrates how to create and remove geofences using the
[GeofencingApi](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/GeofencingApi.html).
Monitor geofence transitions and creates notifications whenever a device enters or exits a geofence.

Introduction
============

Geofencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of
nearby features, defined as the user's proximity to locations that may be of
interest. To mark a location of interest, you specify its latitude and
longitude. To adjust the proximity for the location, you add a radius. The
latitude, longitude, and radius define a geofence. You can have multiple active
geofences at one time.

Location Services treats a geofences as an area rather than as a points and
proximity. This allows it to detect when the user enters or exits a geofence.
For each geofence, you can ask Location Services to send you entrance events,
exit events, or both. You can also limit the duration of a geofence by
specifying an expiration duration in milliseconds. After the geofence expires,
Location Services automatically removes it.

To run this sample, **location must be enabled**.
